## Programming paradigm 
A programming paradigm is a fundamental style or approach to programming, guiding the structure and organization of code.<br> Common paradigms include:
- [Procedural programming](procedural.md)
- [Object oriented programming](oop.md)
- [Functional programming](functional.md)
- [Event driven programming](event.md)
- Imperative programming 

*Programming paradigm is like a way of thinking that helps programmers to write code. It's a style that guides how you organize and structure your programs.*

### Multiple Paradigm
Multi-paradigm programming refers to the capability of a programming language to support multiple programming paradigms. Languages like Python, C++, JavaScript and Java are considered as multi-paradigm because they allow developers to use various programming styles based on the needs of a particular task.
