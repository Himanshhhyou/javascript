## Programming paradigm 
A programming paradigm is a fundamental style or approach to programming, guiding the structure and organization of code.<br> Common paradigms include:
- Procedural programming 
- Object oriented programming 
- Functional programming
- Event driven programming
- Imperative programming 

*Programming paradigm is like a way of thinking that helps programmers to write code. It's a style that guides how you organize and structure your programs.*

### Multiple Paradigm
Multi-paradigm programming refers to the capability of a programming language to support multiple programming paradigms, which are approaches to solving problems and structuring code. Common paradigms include imperative, declarative, object-oriented, and functional programming. Languages like Python, C++, and Java are considered multi-paradigm because they allow developers to use various programming styles based on the needs of a particular task. This flexibility can enhance code expressiveness and support diverse problem-solving strategies.

## Event driven language

An event-driven language is a programming language or framework designed to handle and respond to events, which are occurrences or happenings that can be triggered by the user, system, or external sources. In event-driven programming, the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (e.g., clicks, keystrokes), sensor outputs, or messages from other programs

## Object oriented programming language

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes.
An object is a combination of data and the actions that can be performed on that data. Imagine a car as an object: it has data (like color and speed) and actions (like accelerating and braking).
