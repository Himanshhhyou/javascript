## Multiple Paradigm
Multi-paradigm programming refers to the capability of a programming language to support multiple programming paradigms, which are approaches to solving problems and structuring code. Common paradigms include imperative, declarative, object-oriented, and functional programming. Languages like Python, C++, and Java are considered multi-paradigm because they allow developers to use various programming styles based on the needs of a particular task. This flexibility can enhance code expressiveness and support diverse problem-solving strategies.

## Object oriented programming language

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes.
An object is a combination of data and the actions that can be performed on that data. Imagine a car as an object: it has data (like color and speed) and actions (like accelerating and braking).
