### Event driven language 

An event-driven programming is a programming language designed to handle and respond to events, which are occurrences or happenings that can be triggered by the user, system, or external sources. In event-driven programming, the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (e.g., clicks, keystrokes), sensor outputs, or messages from other programs.
